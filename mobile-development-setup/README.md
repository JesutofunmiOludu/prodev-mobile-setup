This document explains how I set up my mobile development environment using the Expo Framework and Expo Go.

## Tools Installed

| Tool        | Version / Status |
|------------|------------------|
| Node.js LTS | Installed |
| VS Code     | Installed |
| OS          | Windows |
| Expo Go     | Installed on physical device |

## Why Expo Go

Expo Go allows me to test React Native applications directly on my physical mobile device without installing heavy Android or iOS emulators. This saves system resources and works across different device types easily.

## Expo Go Installation Process

### Step 1 – Visit Expo Go Website  
I visited the official Expo Go page:

https://expo.dev/go

---

### Step 2 – Choose Latest SDK Version  
On the website, I selected the latest SDK version available.

---

### Step 3 – Install on My Device  

- I opened the **Google Play Store** on my Android phone.  
- I searched for **Expo Go**.  
- I installed the app successfully.

---

### Step 4 – Open the App

After installation, I opened the Expo Go app on my phone.

---

### Step 5 – Login / Create Account

I created a new Expo account and logged into the Expo Go app successfully.

## Challenges Faced

| Issue | Solution |
|------|----------|
| PowerShell blocked npm scripts | Fixed by changing execution policy using `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` |
| Internet connection delay | Restarted network and retried installation |

---

## Final Status

Expo Go is fully installed and ready for testing React Native applications from my development environment.
